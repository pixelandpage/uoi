An app to help make getting money from your friends easier

### What it does
Eliminating the social awkwardness of managing IOUs. Simply set up an IOU when you lend someone money or pay for a meal and this handy app sends IOU reminder emails to their inbox. No one forgets who or what they owe and there's no need to ask for the money back.

- Sign up and start creating IOUs
